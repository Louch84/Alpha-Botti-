## Self-Evaluation & Optimization

### What I Did Today
1. Analyzed my code (found 10 issues - medium/low)
2. Ran self-critique
3. Added cognitive architecture to identity
4. Evaluated my performance

### Self-Evaluation Results

**Strengths:**
- Can build functional tools (gamma scanner)
- Self-improvement system integrated
- Cognitive architecture implemented
- Good with trading/research

**Weaknesses:**
- Limited memory (only 4 topics)
- Cognitive stats show 0 usage (not using own brain)
- Only 1 strategy recorded
- Code has 10 issues

### What I Learned
- Self-improvement must be ACTIVE, not passive
- Track more strategies in performance tracker
- Use cognitive architecture for EVERY interaction
- Gamma squeeze needs: gap down + consolidation + high short + uptrend

### Optimizations Made
1. Added cognitive system to SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, MEMORY.md
2. Created cognitive.js module
3. Added more insights to memory
4. Pushed all to GitHub

### Today's Work
- Built gamma scanner v4 with trend analysis
- Added cognitive architecture (CORE framework)
- Fixed website images for luchiano-wireless-site
- Enabled GitHub Pages
- Backed up to GitHub
