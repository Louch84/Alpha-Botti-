## What We Built Today

### Gamma Squeeze Scanner (V2)
- Built a scanner that finds gap-down + tight consolidation stocks
- Process: Scan broad stock universe → filter by gap + consolidation → check gamma variables → score
- Final version: scanner_v2.js
- Found AMC as today's setup (47/100 score, -12.8% gap down, 22.1% short interest)

### Tech Stack
- Node.js with axios, no Python/pip available in sandbox
- Yahoo Finance API for price data
- Hardcoded short interest data (needs real-time source)

### Key Lessons
- Gap down + consolidation is the setup we want
- Filters need to be in right order: technical first, then gamma variables
- AMC passed because it gapped down 12.8%, tightly consolidating, high short interest
- Most gap-down stocks don't have high short interest (that's why few setups)

### Notes
- Removed daily cron (user wants manual only)
- Scanner runs only when asked
- Need real-time short interest data source

## Pending
- Bootstrap still on hold (user said they'll add more later)
- Need to organize workspace better

## Research Done (Self-Improvement)

### Short Interest Data Sources
- Most free sources blocked (NASDAQ, StockAnalysis, CNN)
- FINVIX scraping blocked
- Yahoo quote API blocked
- Alpha Vantage, Polygon, Twelve Data - require FREE API keys
- Best option: Keep hardcoded list, update manually

### Options Data Sources  
- CBOE, Barchart - work but require JS rendering (hard to scrape)
- Yahoo chart works, options API blocked
- API keys needed for clean data

### Created
- RESEARCH.md - Full analysis of data sources
- Updated MEMORY.md with findings

### Self-Improvement System Built
- **Memory 2.0** - Smart memory with auto-tagging, priority, search
- **Performance Tracker** - Track success/failure of strategies
- **Self Analyzer** - Code review, issue detection
- **Main runner** - Integrated self-improvement cycle
