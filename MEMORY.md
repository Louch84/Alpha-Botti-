## Key Projects

### Gamma Squeeze Scanner
- Built to find gap-down + tight consolidation stocks with gamma squeeze potential
- Location: ~/openclaw/workspace/gamma_scanner/
- Latest: scanner_v2.js
- Process: Scan stocks → gap down + consolidation filter → gamma variables → score

### Bootstrap
- On hold - Louch said they'll add more later

## What I've Learned

### Trading/Gamma Squeeze Setup
1. Stock gaps down significantly (5%+)
2. Price tightly consolidating (low volatility)
3. High short interest (fuel for squeeze)
4. Penny options available ($0.01-$0.10)
5. Wait for upward momentum to fill gap

### Tech Stack
- Node.js preferred (works in sandbox, no pip)
- Yahoo Finance API for price data
- Hardcoded short interest data (needs upgrade)

## What I Should Focus On

### Self-Improvement
1. Update memory after each session
2. Research without being asked
3. Organize workspace proactively
4. Improve tools I'm building

### Projects to Build/Improve
1. Better gamma scanner with real-time data
2. Short interest data source
3. Options data source
4. Telegram/Discord alerts automation
